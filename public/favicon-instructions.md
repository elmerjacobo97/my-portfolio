# Favicon Setup Instructions

## Required Favicon Files

To complete the SEO optimization, you need to create the following favicon files and place them in the `/public` directory:

### Files needed:
- `favicon.ico` (16x16, 32x32, 48x48 sizes in one file)
- `favicon-16x16.png`
- `favicon-32x32.png`
- `apple-touch-icon.png` (180x180)
- `android-chrome-192x192.png`
- `android-chrome-512x512.png`
- `og-image.jpg` (1200x630 for social media)
- `profile-image.jpg` (for structured data)
- `screenshot-desktop.png` (1280x720 for PWA)
- `screenshot-mobile.png` (390x844 for PWA)

2. Export in different sizes:
   - 16x16, 32x32, 180x180, 192x192, 512x512
3. For favicon.ico, use an ICO converter online

### Option 3: Using your logo
If you already have a logo:
1. Make it square (add padding if needed)
2. Ensure it's recognizable at small sizes
3. Use high contrast colors
4. Avoid too much detail

## Quick Setup with Placeholder

If you need to launch quickly, you can:

2. Use online tools to generate all sizes
3. Replace with professional designs later

## Color Recommendations

Based on your current theme:
- Primary color: Your brand color
- Background: White or your theme background
- Ensure good contrast for visibility

## Testing

After adding the files, test:
1. Browser tab icon appears correctly
2. Bookmark icon looks good
3. Social media previews work (use Facebook Debugger, Twitter Card Validator)
4. PWA install prompt shows proper icon

- Consider creating different icon variants for light/dark themes
- Test on multiple devices and browsers
